| 1.) | SIH Hackathon 2022 & 2023  | DR725 | Geotagging of all educational institutions integrated with virtual tour on Bharat Map so that any students/parents can visit any part of the country on map and take virtual tour along with facilities/courses available across the country.|
| 2.) | SIH Hackathon 2022 & 2023  | RK1121 | a)	- Virtual reality solution for healthcare sector especially for training the new medical practitioner  and Para Medical Staff." b)- VR solution for emergency rehearsals like fire, flood etc. Provide safety training using Virtual   Reality|
| 3.) | SIH Hackathon 2023  | SIH1438 | A virtual reality-based training for CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear) disaster response for NDRF is a training program that may uses virtual reality technology to simulate various CBRN emergency scenarios. It may designed to train NDRF personnel to respond effectively to such emergencies, as currently there is no system available to train them in this regard. Virtual reality-based training immerses trainees in realistic scenarios that simulate the effects of CBRN emergencies. The technology allows trainees to experience the situations as if they were real without exposing them to actual risks. Through the use of specialized software and equipment, trainees can interact with virtual objects, practice rescue techniques. and learn to handle hazardous materials and situations. This type of training can be particularly useful for NDRF rescuers who may face hazardous and high-risk situations during CBRN emergencies. It can help them to gain the necessary skills. knowledge, and confidence to manage such emergencies effectively, which can ultimately save lives and minimize damage. Overall, the development of a virtual reality-based training program for CBRN disaster response for NDRF may be a necessary step to improve the training and preparedness of NDRF personnel for CBRN emergencies. |
| 4.) | SIH Hackathon 2023  | SIH1501 | There are primerly three tissue nourishment theories known as 'Dhatuposhan Nyaya described by Acharya's. They are as follow: 1. Ksheeradadhi Nyaya (Theory of Transformation)- This is compared to the conversion of milk (ksheera) into curd (dadhi) in entirety. This complete transformation of one Dhatu to another is called Sarvatma Parinama (total bio- conversion). According to this theory, nutrients getting converted into tissues. 2.Kedarikulya Nyaya (Theory of Transportation)- According to this theory, nourishment of the tissues can be compared to irrigation of fields by water from a canal. This explains supply of nutrients through circulatory system. 3.Khalckapota Nyaya (Theory of Selection)- Like pigeons pecking the grains from a threshing floor and carrying it back to their nests depend on the direction and the time required for them to travel. The nutrition required by a dhatu (tissue) is selected from the essence part of food being circulated. To understand and apply these principles/process at tissue level scientifically Virtual Reality (VR) technology may be helpful.|
| 5.) | SIH Hackathon 2023 | SIH1410 | Develop an Augmented Reality (AR) or Virtual Reality (VR) system for the live training of troops.AR/VR system for live training of troops requires expertise in hardware, software development, content creation, and user experience design. Collaboration with domain experts, instructional designers, and technology specialists can help ensure the system meets the specific needs of the military training environment.|
| 6.) | Devfolio | https://devfolio.co/projects/ingrid-d-rental-platform-53a1 | Augmented Reality to offer a virtual simulation of the Property. It makes visiting various apartments and flats less time-consuming as users can easily view the 3D model of the apartment. Ingrid makes it convenient for customers to operate the rental system without time wastage.|
| 7.) | SIH Hackathon 2023 | SIH1281 | To create a fun, interactive, and engaging gamified platform that educates children in India about their rights and empowers them to stand up for themselves and others. Target audience: The platform is intended for children between the ages of 8 and 16, and will be designed to be inclusive and accessible to all children regardless of their socio-economic background, gender, or other demographic factors. Key features: 1 Interactive gameplay that is based on real-life scenarios and challenges related to child rights, using storytelling, visualizations, and immersive experiences to educate children on their legal rights and procedures. 2. Modular and adaptive learning modules that provide progressive and personalized learning paths, catering to individual user needs and preferences. 3. Accessible and user-friendly design, incorporating multimedia elements and language translation features to promote inclusivity and accessibility. 4. Social and community features enable children to connect and collaborate with other users, legal experts, and organizations, creating a sense of community and empowerment. 5. Integration with child rights organizations and support services, enabling children to access legal advice and assistance as needed. Deliverables: 1. A functional prototype of the gamified platform, demonstrating key features and functionality. 2. User testing and feedback data, indicating the effectiveness and usability of the platform. 3. A comprehensive report and presentation on the development process, including design decisions, technical challenges, and ethical considerations. Expected impact: 4. Increased legal literacy and awareness among children in India, enabling them to make informed decisions about their rights and responsibilities. 5. Empowerment of children to stand up for their rights and the rights of others, leading to greater social justice and equity. 6. Enhanced engagement and participation of children in legal processes and systems, leading to more effective and equitable outcomes.|
